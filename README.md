# fsds_workshop

Web applications are the way information is delivered, and machine learning systems are frequently driving the decisions behind the applications. As machine learning increasingly becomes a part of the standard tech stack, it is valuable, and perhaps at some future point expected, that data scientists and web developers have an intuition into how the other side works. Join me for a half day workshop and learn how to use the tools of both disciplines together, and build your first smart application.
